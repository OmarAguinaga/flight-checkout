# FLight Checkout

This project was created using the create react app

## Run Project

To run this project download or clone the repository to your machine

`git clone https://github.com/OmarAguinaga/flight-checkout.git`

`npm install`

`npm start`

## The Application

This application has the following functionality

* The check-in application lists seats in the plane that passengers can choose
* Different seats should have different fees (free, window, aisle
  more leg-room, etc.)
* A passenger can skip choosing a seat and check-in for free. Then they get a random seat.
* A passenger can pick a seat and check-in for a fixed price
* A passenger can only check-in to one seat

This application lacks of the following functionality

* The seat is reserved for 3 minutes for the passenger until they pay

Because of the time given it was difficult to implement proper tests for this application, as a following steep I would normaly finish the requirements (Reserve the seat for 3 minutes) and the add tests

## Styling

All the styling was done using CSS and trying to implement BEM structure, another steep of this application if I had more time would be to replace CSS with styled components
